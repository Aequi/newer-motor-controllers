More recent design.
Si31-3
Switches to non-isolated parts limiting voltage to 80V however significant size and cost reductions.
Powersupply integrated 15v, 5v and 3.3v.
Water jet copper parts soldered to rear section but it's fine without provided currents aren't extreme.

STM32f407 riser PCB
actually stm32f405, allows an STM32 running VESC firmware to be attached to the same pin layout as Ti instaspin launchpads.
